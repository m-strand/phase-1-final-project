Spotify Artist Diary

Description
This SPA allows you to search for an artist, select if you want to generate that artist's albums or top tracks, and then returns the selected list using the Spotify Developer API. Once that list is generated, the user can save any album or track that they would like to listen to later using the 'save' button.
